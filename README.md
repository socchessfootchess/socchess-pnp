# Socchess — Print & Play

**Live site:** https://socchessfootchess.github.io/socchess-pnp/

Soccer meets chess. Print, cut, play. This repo hosts the public PnP kit:
- 4-page **Board** (24×18 grid, 0.25″ overlaps)
- **Tokens** in two team colors (0.55″), ball tokens (0.30″)
- **Rules** (friendly, patent-based)

## Quick rules
- **Teams:** 11 pieces — GK + 10 field pieces (Q/R/B/N). For field pieces there must be **2–3 of each**.
- **Kickoff & after every goal (Forward Rule):** Ball-holder picks **F (0–10)** → all 10 field pieces advance F straight forward; opponent picks **D (0–10)** → advance D. GKs don’t move. Landing conflicts by rank **GK/K > Q > R > B > N**; loser moves to an adjacent empty square.
- **Score by shots only.** 15s per action. Carry: Q/R/B up to 5; GK/N unlimited. Pass: Q/R/B any distance on clear lines; N one L-jump; GK one square.

## Printing
- Print PDFs at **100% / Actual size**, letter, portrait.
- Trim on crop marks; tape tiles using the overlap.
- Cardstock recommended; a **1″ circle punch** helps.
